# BUG#45214
# The common part of the "rpl_get_primary_version_and_clock" test. 
# Restart replica under network disconnection between replica and primary
# following the steps:
#    0 - Set DEBUG_SYNC_ACTION to wait 
#        before call mysql_real_query(...) function in get_primary_version_and_clock(...)
#        function and hang here
#    1 - activate a sync-point through the $dbug_sync_point argument of the test
#    2 - shutdown primary server for simulating network disconnection
#    3 - signal to the IO thread through $debug_sync_action to unhold from the sync-point
#    4 - check if the replica I/O thread tries to reconnect to primary. 
#
# Note: make sure to initialize the $debug_sync_action and $dbug_sync_point
#       before calling the test script.
#
# Pattern of usage:
#
# The caller test supplies the DBUG_EXECUTE_IF name
#
#    let $dbug_sync_point = 'dbug_execute_if_name';
#
# as well as the action list for DEBUG_SYNC
#    
#    let $debug_sync_action= 'now signal signal_name';
#
# The $dbug_sync_point becomes the value of @@global.debug generating
# a newly started IO-replica thread's session value.
# Notice incremental operations to add and remove dbug_execute_if_name
# from the global variable allows propagation more dbug arguments
# out of mtr.
# The action list is to fire at proper time according to test logics
# (see pp 0-4 above).
#
