Setting up fake replication from MYSQL_TEST_DIR/std_data/bug40482-bin.000001
==== Test ====
START REPLICA SQL_THREAD;
include/wait_for_replica_sql_error.inc [errno=1594]
Last_SQL_Error = 'Relay log read failure: Could not parse relay log event entry. The possible reasons are: the primary's binary log is corrupted (you can check this by running 'mysqlbinlog' on the binary log), the replica's relay log is corrupted (you can check this by running 'mysqlbinlog' on the relay log), a network problem, or a bug in the primary's or replica's MySQL code. If you want to check the primary's binary log or replica's relay log, you will be able to know their names by issuing 'SHOW REPLICA STATUS' on this replica.'
