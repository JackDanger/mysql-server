#BUG#1353750 : REPLICATION FROM PRIMARY WITH NEW CHECKSUM ALGORITHM  
#
# ==== Purpose ====
# 
# The test check for the condition when the primary uses a checksum algorithm 
# which is unknown to the replica. In such a case the primary will send the 
# events with the new checksum while the replica treats it as no checksum. 
# After the fix the replica will stop if it gets a new checksum from the primary
# with the error message.
#
# ====Method====
#
# For testing out the above mentioned functionality we have injected a fault  
# in the replica's code and trigger it through debug library.
# In the case we get the error message we stop the replica with the 
# error code 1593 and then restart the replica.
