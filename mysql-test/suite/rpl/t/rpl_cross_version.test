# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Verify cross-version replication from an old primary to the up-to-date replica
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# Feed to the replica server a binlog recorded on an old version primary 
# via setting up replica-to-replica replication. The latter is done by means of
# the opt file and include/setup_fake_relay_log.inc.
# The primary's binlog is treated as a relay log that the SQL thread executes.
