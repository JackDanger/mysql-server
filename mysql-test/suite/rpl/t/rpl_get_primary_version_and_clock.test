# This test verifies if the replica I/O tread tries to reconnect to
# primary when it tries to get the values of the UNIX_TIMESTAMP, SERVER_ID,
# COLLATION_SERVER and TIME_ZONE from primary under network disconnection.
# The COLLATION_SERVER and TIME_ZONE are got only on primary server version 4.
# So they can't be verified by test case here.
# Finish the following tests by calling its common test script:  
# extra/rpl_tests/rpl_get_primary_version_and_clock.test.
